# How to Install
Install the latest version of the datapack. Go into your world folder and place the zip file inside the datapacks folder and uncompress it. Finally, delete the original zip file.

# How to Start
When everyone load into the game, a player with operator permissions simply needs to run the command: `/function assassins:start`.

# How to Play
Assassins is a simple game where everyone shares the same objective: be the last man standing.

# How to Enjoy the Game
All this datapack provides is a means to play the game, but to properly enjoy the game there are a few guidelines players should follow:
1. Only kill your target or the person targetting you.
2. Create reasonably small teams.
3. Use [Simple Voice Chat Mod](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) mod as a means of communication.
4. Actively engage with others during the game. Don't just crouch in a hole the entire time.
5. No headpiece armor slot. Makes PvP more possible.

# How to End
Be the last man standing.
